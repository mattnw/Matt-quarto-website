## Editing

I am currently co- editor in chief at [Europeâ€™s Journal of Psychology](https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop) and an acting editor at [Meta-Psychology](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/index). Both of these journals are diamond open access. From 2023 to 2025 I was an associate editor at [Collabra: Psychology](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra).

## Peer reviewing

I am an editorial board member at [Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/ampps) and [Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/psychological_science). I also perform ad hoc reviews for a range of journals. My peer reviewing history can be viewed on my [Web of Science page](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/H-9642-2014) (formerly Publons).
